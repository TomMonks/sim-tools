    Non Stationary Poisson Process via Thinning.

    Thinning is an acceptance-rejection approach to sampling
    inter-arrival times (IAT) from a time dependent distribution
    where each time period follows its own exponential distribution.

    There are two random variables employed in sampling: an exponential
    distribution (used to sample IAT) and a uniform distibution (used
    to accept/reject samples).

    All IATs are sampled from an Exponential distribution with the highest
    arrival rate (most frequent). These arrivals are then rejected (thinned)
    proportional to the ratio of the current arrival rate to the maximum
    arrival rate.  The algorithm executes until a sample is accepted. The IAT
    returned is the sum of all the IATs that were sampled.
